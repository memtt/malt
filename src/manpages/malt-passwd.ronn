malt-passwd(1) -- Password editor for MALT web GUI
==================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`malt-passwd` {username} [password]

## DESCRIPTION

The MALT web GUI provided by malt-webview(1) is secured by a local password which is configured
by `malt-passwd` command and stored into `~/.malt/passwd` file. It will be called automatically
the first time you call `malt-webview`.

`malt-passwd` is essentially a wrapper to call a script provided by nodeJS module `htpasswd` so it
also supports all the options it provides. You can refer to the documentation of this module for
more details : https://www.npmjs.com/package/htpasswd.

## ENVIRONMENT

 * `MALT_NODEJS`:
   Can be setup to tell which nodeJS to use if the script cannot find it by itself.

## VERSION

   This is the manpage of MALT version 1.2.4.
