malt-qt5(1) -- Webserver for the MALT web GUI
=================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`malt-qt5` [OPTIONS] -i {malt-profile.json}

## DESCRIPTION

The MALT QT web view embedded a QT webkit browser to display the web GUI hosted by a nodeJS script 
managed by `malt-webview` command.

## OPTIONS

 * `-i`, `--input-file`:
   This option is required and provide the input profile file (json format) to explore.
 * `-n`, '--no-auth':
   Disable usage of HTTP authentification to secure the pages of the GUI. Caution, all the
   users connected on the machine can access the GUI so to your code.
 * `-o`, `--override`:
   If you copy a profile file from a remote machine to your local one, your code might
   be stored into another place (not same user, not same path). Thanks to override options
   you can alias some paths to make it transparent to the GUI and be able to find your
   source code. The format is *src_path1:dest_path1,src_path2,dest_path2*. The easiest use
   is to override the root directory of your project.
 * `version`:
   Display the current version of MALT you are using.
 * `-h`, `--help`:
   Display a short help message to summarize the available options.

## ENVIRONMENT

 * `MALT_NODEJS`:
   Can be setup to tel which nodeJS to use if the script cannot find it by itself.

## VERSION

   This is the manpage of MALT version 1.2.4.
